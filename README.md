## Hi there 👋

I'm Nina, an iOS developer.
I build apps with Swift and SwiftUI.
My tech stack is Swift, SwiftUI, and AI-assisted development. My tools are Xcode, Figma, and Cursor.
I've shipped multiple apps to the App Store, including RawFocus (minimalist focus timer), Olla (perimenopause symptom tracker), and CashTap (tip tracking for service workers).
I've built over 100 public repos.
Fun Facts:

- 17 years building location-independent businesses
- Transitioned from entrepreneur to iOS developer
- Ship apps in weeks, not months
